          At <a href="https://ai4bazaar.com/" style={{color: 'inherit'}}><b>AI4Bazaar</b></a>, we aim to provide a seamless digital transformation for small and local businesses. Our goal is to make the process of adopting digital solutions as smooth as possible. However, we understand that sometimes circumstances change, and you may need to cancel or request a refund. Below are the details of our refund and cancellation policy, which complies with industry standards and Razorpayâ€™s requirements.

          <b>Website Development Services</b>
        <p>
          Customers can request a full refund within 14 days of the website deployment if no additional services such as e-commerce integration or digital marketing solutions have been used. If additional services were utilized, a partial refund will be processed based on the value of services rendered. Refunds will be processed back to the original payment method used during the transaction.

      If the service has not been initiated within 30 days of purchase, customers can request a full refund. If services such as e-commerce setup or digital marketing campaigns have already been initiated, refunds will be prorated based on the work completed at the time of the cancellation. Digital marketing campaigns once started are non-refundable.
